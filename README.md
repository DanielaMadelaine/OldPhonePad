# OldPhonePad 
Implementation of an old Key pad of a mobile phone. Each button has a number to identify it and pressing a button 
multiple times will cycle through the letters on it allowing each button to represent more than one letter.

For example, pressing 2 once will return ‘A’ but pressing twice 
in succession will return‘B’. 

“#” will always be included at the end of every input.
if your input contains “*” means that it has to delete the last letter and delete all the similiar letter in the output before *.
it is contemplated if there is an space in the input. Build with C#
